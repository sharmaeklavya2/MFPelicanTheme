# MF Pelican Theme

'MF Pelican Theme' (MFPT) is a theme for [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com), a static site generator.

MFPT is designed to be as simple and lightweight as possible without being an eyesore.
This philosophy is borrowed partially from [here](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com) and
[here](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com).

MFPT doesn't have any dependencies.

This theme's CSS uses flexbox. This makes the CSS simpler, but makes it incompatible with very old browsers.
